&lt;p&gt;CQRS splits things up: one model for commands (writes), another for queries (reads). Your read side can be super fast and tailored for how people use your data, while your write side focuses on keeping everything correct and consistent. Bottom line: stick with CRUD for straightforward apps, but consider CQRS if you&apos;re hitting pain points with performance, complexity, or scaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read and write performance of any system has an inherent imbalance where writes are more expensive. The traditional approach of using a single data model becomes increasingly difficult to optimize for both read and write together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Split the conceptual model into separate models for update and display, which are referred to as command and query respectively, hence being called &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;CommandQuerySeparation&lt;/code&gt;. This works really well when working in more complicated domains, where having the same conceptual model for commands and queries leads to a more complex model that does neither well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) is a software architectural pattern that separates the operations that read data (queries) from those that update data (commands). By decoupling these responsibilities, CQRS enables more scalable, flexible, and maintainable systems, especially in complex domains. This pattern is commonly used in event-driven architectures and systems that require high performance, scalability, or have complex business logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The difference between Commands and Queries&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commands and queries are like two sides of the same coin when you’re building apps. Think of commands as instructions you give your app to make something happen—like adding a new user, updating a profile, or deleting a post. They’re all about changing stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Queries, on the other hand, are more like questions you ask your app. You’re not trying to change anything; you just want some information back. For example, “Show me all the posts from today” or “What’s the user’s email address?” Queries just fetch data and leave everything else untouched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in short: commands make changes, queries just get info. Keeping them separate helps keep your code organized and easier to manage, especially as your app grows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of using CQRS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best things about CQRS is how it lets you scale reads and writes independently. For instance, if your app gets a lot more reads than writes, you can focus on making the read side faster and more robust without complicating the write side. I’ve found that using different data models for reading and writing makes life a lot easier—your read model can be optimized for speed and convenience, while your write model can focus on data integrity and validation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security is another area where CQRS shines. Since commands and queries take separate paths, it’s much simpler to control who can do what, without getting lost in a maze of permissions. When you’re working with complex business rules, keeping commands and queries apart really helps prevent your codebase from becoming a tangled mess. Personally, I’ve noticed it’s much easier to add new features or make changes when everything is clearly separated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performance is a big plus, too. Reads can be lightning fast and easily cached, while writes can take the time they need to ensure everything is correct. And if you’re interested in event sourcing, CQRS is a natural fit—you can keep a complete history of every change, which is super helpful for debugging or understanding how your data ended up in its current state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Typical use cases and scenarios&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Context:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CQRS is a concept that builds on Domain Driven Design (DDD), and an important strategic concept of DDD is the so-called &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Bounded Context&lt;/code&gt;. There can be multiple Bounded Contexts in a single application and they can be implemented in different ways&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&apos;s the thing—most systems actually fit the CRUD mental model just fine, and you should stick with that unless you have a good reason not to. CQRS works best when applied to specific &lt;em&gt;bounded contexts&lt;/em&gt; rather than your entire system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CQRS really shines in high-performance applications where you have way more reads than writes (or vice versa). It lets you separate the load and even use different systems for each if needed. But remember, there are other options too, like using separate read/write databases or a reporting database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CQRS vs. traditional CRUD&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how does CQRS stack up against the classic CRUD approach? Well, CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) is what most of us start with—one model, one set of operations, everything in one place. It’s simple and works great for a lot of apps, especially when things aren’t too complicated and performance isn’t a huge concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as your app grows, you might notice that trying to optimize for both reads and writes with a single model gets tricky. You end up with code that’s hard to maintain, and sometimes you have to make weird compromises just to keep things working. That’s where CQRS comes in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With CQRS, you split things up: one model for commands (writes/updates), and another for queries (reads). This means you can make your read side super fast and tailored for how people actually use your data, while keeping your write side focused on making sure everything stays correct and consistent. It’s like having two toolkits—one for building stuff, and one for looking at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short: CRUD is awesome for straightforward apps, but if you’re running into pain points with performance, complexity, or scaling, CQRS might be worth a look. It’s not a silver bullet, but it can make life a lot easier in the right situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Event sourcing and its relationship with CQRS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, let’s talk about event sourcing and how it fits in with CQRS. Imagine you’re keeping a diary, but instead of just writing down the current state of your life (“Today I have a dog and a new job”), you jot down every single thing that happens (“Adopted a dog,” “Started a new job,” “Moved to a new city,” etc.). That’s basically what event sourcing is for your app—it stores every change as an event, rather than just the latest state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, why does this matter for CQRS? Well, CQRS is all about separating reads and writes, right? Event sourcing takes this a step further by making your write side all about recording events. Every time something changes, you save an event (“UserCreated,” “OrderPlaced,” “EmailChanged”). Then, when you need to know the current state, you just replay all those events in order to rebuild it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cool part is that this works really well with CQRS. Your command side (writes) just records events, and your query side (reads) can build whatever view of the data it needs by processing those events. Plus, you get a full history of everything that’s ever happened in your system, which is awesome for debugging, audits, or just figuring out “how did we get here?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, event sourcing isn’t required for CQRS, but they’re like peanut butter and jelly—they just go together nicely, especially in complex systems where you want that extra flexibility and traceability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Real-world example&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great metaphor for CQRS would be the old-fashioned manual banking systems (before software existed). There were tellers who dealt with monetary transactions - they would spend the entire work day adding, removing and transferring sums of money between accounts. That&apos;s the transactional &quot;system&quot;. And then at the end of the day/week/month the accountants in each branch of the bank would go over all the transaction ledgers and generate the up-to-date balances, calculate the interest due and various fees, etc. The accountants could see the bigger picture, while the tellers just cared about helping customers move money around. Those accountants represent the reporting &quot;systems&quot; which consume the business events coming from the transactional side, and have an eventually-consistent birds eye view of everything happening on the transactional side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion and further reading&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, there are various ways to optimize your system. CQRS works well when you have a drastic difference between your read and write models, but being forced to use the same model for both is causing friction or loss of performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is a summary with some of my personal opinions on this post on Reddit - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/comments/1mpiqmz/why_composition_over_inheritance_is_still_hard_in/?share_id=XhntU5Nhp8bkMygmQZslj&amp;#x26;utm_content=1&amp;#x26;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;#x26;utm_name=iossmf&amp;#x26;utm_source=share&amp;#x26;utm_term=22&quot;&gt;Why &quot;composition over inheritance&quot; is still hard in C#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow I have felt this issue, but recently learned the problem isn&apos;t a personal one but more generic.
TIL: “Prefer composition over inheritance.” It’s a common design principle meant to avoid fragile class hierarchies. But if you’re a C# developer, you’ve probably noticed something: inheritance is easy, while composition often feels like a chore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s explore why, what the community says about it, and how other languages (like Go) approach the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Inheritance is effortless in C#&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C# makes inheritance ridiculously convenient. Want to extend a class? It’s literally one line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;MyButton&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token type-list&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// override OnClick or add custom behavior&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s it — you instantly get all of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Button&lt;/code&gt;’s behavior, plus your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Composition is boilerplate-heavy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let’s try the same idea using composition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;MyButton&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Button&lt;/span&gt; _button &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token constructor-invocation class-name&quot;&gt;Button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token return-type class-name&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Draw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; _button&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Draw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token return-type class-name&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Click&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; _button&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Click&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token return-type class-name&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Resize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; _button&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Resize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// …and dozens more methods to delegate&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice the problem? You’re writing tons of glue code just to forward calls to the underlying object. No special syntax exists to reduce this boilerplate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That friction alone pushes many developers back toward inheritance, even when composition would be a better long-term choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Frameworks don’t help&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not just the syntax. Many .NET frameworks (WinForms, WPF, Unity) were designed around subclassing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They expect you to override &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;OnX&lt;/code&gt; methods and extend classes directly. Over time, this leads to brittle hierarchies that are hard to untangle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one developer put it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve wasted months untangling WinForms inheritance chains… absolute nightmare.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The button example: subclass explosion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A classic illustration is the humble UI button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want a blue button → subclass.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want a pill-shaped button → subclass.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want a button that logs clicks → subclass again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, you’re juggling classes like &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;BluePillLoggingButton&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;RoundedRedButtonWithAnalytics&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With composition, you could build a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Button&lt;/code&gt; that has a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ColorBehavior&lt;/code&gt;, a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ShapeBehavior&lt;/code&gt;, and a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;LoggingBehavior&lt;/code&gt;. Each concern stays separate, and you don’t drown in subclasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The catch: in C#, composition means writing all those delegate methods by hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What other languages do better&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Languages like Kotlin or Go provide syntax that makes composition less painful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Kotlin, you can delegate automatically:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;kotlin&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-kotlin&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-kotlin&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;LoggingRepository&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;val&lt;/span&gt; repo&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Repository&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Repository &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;by&lt;/span&gt; repo &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;override&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;fun&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;save&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Item&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string-literal singleline&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Logging save&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        repo&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;save&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;by repo&lt;/code&gt; forwards all the methods for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Go, there’s embedding:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;go&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-go&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-go&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; Engine &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;e Engine&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; fmt&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Engine starting...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; Car &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    Engine  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// embedded, not just a field&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;c Car&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Drive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    c&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// method is accessible directly!&lt;/span&gt;
    fmt&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Car driving...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go’s embedding is essentially composition with inheritance-like syntax. No boilerplate, but still flexible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Community strategies in C#&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since C# doesn’t support delegation out of the box, developers resort to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Source generators to auto-generate forwarding methods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dynamic proxies for runtime delegation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mixin libraries to simulate traits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Or just sticking with inheritance when it’s “good enough”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others have suggested a hybrid approach: use composition for flexible behaviors, inheritance for core identity, and aggressively seal classes to prevent hierarchy sprawl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The takeaway&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Composition often produces cleaner, more modular code. But in C#, it comes at a cost: inheritance is one line, composition is 30 lines of boilerplate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until the language itself adds built-in delegation or mixin support, “prefer composition over inheritance” will remain easier said than done.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[IEnumerable execution is deferred]]></title><description><![CDATA[Backstory While debugging a piece of C# code, we added a stopwatch to measure the performance of various code sections.

&lt;p&gt;While debugging a piece of C# code, we added a stopwatch to measure the performance of various code sections. For some reason, looping over a set of elements took 50 seconds, whereas all the preprocessing just before looping over it took less than 0.1 seconds. After several hours of debugging (which was quite humbling), we discovered that the dataset was an IEnumerable. The 50 seconds were actually spent on preprocessing, but due to deferred execution, the stopwatch was showing the time taken to register the query rather than its actual execution. To learn why it happened, continue reading&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog is more for me than for you. Hopefully, five years from now, if I encounter the same issue, Google will recommend my own blog to me ☠️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is Deferred Execution?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deferred execution, also known as lazy evaluation, means that the evaluation of an expression is delayed until its result is actually required. In the context of IEnumerable, this means that when you define a query, it isn&apos;t executed immediately. Instead, the query is only executed when you iterate over the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How Deferred Execution Works&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you create a LINQ query or any other IEnumerable sequence, you&apos;re essentially creating a blueprint for how to obtain the data, not the data itself. The actual execution of this blueprint is postponed until you start iterating over the sequence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; numbers &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token constructor-invocation class-name&quot;&gt;List&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; evenNumbers &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; numbers&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Where&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;n &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; n &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// At this point, no filtering has actually occurred. In this example, evenNumbers is an IEnumerable that represents the concept of &quot;all even numbers in the list&quot;. The Where method hasn&apos;t actually been called yet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of Deferred Execution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improved Performance:&lt;/strong&gt; By delaying execution, you can avoid unnecessary computations. If you only need the first few elements of a large sequence, deferred execution allows you to stop processing once you have what you need.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory Efficiency:&lt;/strong&gt; Since the entire result set doesn&apos;t need to be in memory at once, you can work with very large datasets more efficiently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Composition:&lt;/strong&gt; You can build complex queries by chaining multiple operations together without incurring the cost of multiple iterations over the data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;When is the Query Actually Executed?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The query is executed when:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You iterate over the results using a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;foreach&lt;/code&gt; loop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You call methods like &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ToList()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ToArray()&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ToDictionary()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You use operators like &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;First()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Last()&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Count()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Example of Deferred Execution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; numbers &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;int&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; query &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; numbers&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Where&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; n &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Select&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; n &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
numbers&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// This will affect the query result&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;foreach&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; num &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    Console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;WriteLine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;num&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Output: 6, 8, 10, 12&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, even though we modified the numbers list after defining the query, the new element is included in the result. This is because the query isn&apos;t executed until the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;foreach&lt;/code&gt; loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; stopwatch &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token constructor-invocation class-name&quot;&gt;Stopwatch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

Console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;WriteLine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;$&quot;Time taken - &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token expression language-csharp&quot;&gt;stopwatch&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;Elapsed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Around 00:00:02.6724506&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, even though we&apos;re using &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Thread.Sleep&lt;/code&gt; within the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.Select&lt;/code&gt; projection, the processing isn&apos;t executed until we start iterating over all the elements one by one. As a result, the stopwatch shows that looping over the elements takes more than 2 seconds, but this is actually the time spent executing the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.Select&lt;/code&gt; command for each element as it is requested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fun use case for this could be creating a typing awareness animation by introducing randomness into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Thread.Sleep&lt;/code&gt; time to achieve the desired effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Difference Between Deferred Execution in IEnumerable and a List in C#&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the difference between IEnumerable and List in terms of execution is crucial for efficient C# programming. Here&apos;s a comparison:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluation:&lt;/strong&gt; IEnumerable uses deferred execution, while List executes immediately and stores all results in memory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory:&lt;/strong&gt; IEnumerable is memory efficient as it doesn’t store all elements in memory at once, whereas List does, making it more memory-intensive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performance:&lt;/strong&gt; IEnumerable can be more performant when you don&apos;t need all elements at once, while List can be faster when you need repeated access to elements since the data is already in memory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&apos;s an example to illustrate the difference:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; numbers &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token constructor-invocation class-name&quot;&gt;List&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// IEnumerable (deferred execution)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; evenNumbersQuery &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; numbers&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Where&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;n &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; n &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

numbers&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

Console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;WriteLine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;IEnumerable results:&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;foreach&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; num &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; evenNumbersQuery&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    Console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;WriteLine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;num&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Output: 2, 4, 6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

Console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;WriteLine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;List results:&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;foreach&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; num &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; evenNumbersList&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    Console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;WriteLine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;num&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Output: 2, 4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, the IEnumerable query (&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;evenNumbersQuery&lt;/code&gt;) includes the newly added number 6, while the List (&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;evenNumbersList&lt;/code&gt;) does not, as it was evaluated before the addition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choose between IEnumerable and List based on your specific use case, considering factors like data size, frequency of access, and whether you need a snapshot or the most up-to-date data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;99% of the time, I would have gotten away without knowing this, but it&apos;s for that 1% when not having a clear understanding of the platform or framework you work with can come back to bite you xD. It was a valuable learning experience, for sure!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Your one stop solution to sharing your resume with everyone]]></title><description><![CDATA[Things I am going to cover: → Hosting your resume hassle-free → How to use your github.io domain instead of random google drive links…]]></description><link>https://jai-dewani.github.io/blogs/one-stop-solution-to-sharing-your-resume/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jai-dewani.github.io/blogs/one-stop-solution-to-sharing-your-resume/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jul 2021 02:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Things I am going to cover:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been a reoccurring problem in my life, where suppose I am filling a form where I have been asked to provide a URL pointing to my &lt;strong&gt;latest&lt;/strong&gt; resume (emphasis on the latest, cause most of these forms were to be shared with HRs and recruiters so you want all the latest achievements there), and everyone like I used Google Drive to easily share there resume by creating a sharable link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But most often than not my slow brain would think of that &lt;strong&gt;one&lt;/strong&gt; important thing I missed out on in my resume or say I got selected into a prestigious program just days after filling this forum. Now I need this information to be there on that resume accessible from the same URL, so what should I do? But now I think I have a way to solve this problem using GitHub and GitHub Actions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I explain my solution, let me preface that my resume is written in latex which I need to compile to generate my resume in PDF format so I have incorporated that step as well to save my 10 seconds which otherwise I would have wasted on compiling 😂 but you can skip that step if you don&apos;t use latex to generate your resume and directly push your pdf instead of latex files into master branch though you might need to remove all the latex compiling steps from the GitHub actions. Don&apos;t hesitate to reach out to me on Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;www.twitter.com/jai_dewani&quot;&gt;@jai_dewani&lt;/a&gt; if you need any help customizing this repository to your need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is what my solution is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a repository named &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;resume&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commit all the required latex files into the main branch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commit an &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; which when hit should redirect you to your resume.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So theoretically you could just share the URL &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;github-username&gt;.github.io/resume&lt;/code&gt; and it will redirect the person to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;github-username&gt;.github.io/resume/resume.pdf&lt;/code&gt;. Here is what that HTML looks like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token doctype&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token doctype-tag&quot;&gt;DOCTYPE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token name&quot;&gt;html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;html&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;lang&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;en&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;charset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;UTF-8&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;http-equiv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;X-UA-Compatible&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;IE=edge&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;viewport&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Loading, wait....&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    Loading, wait....
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token script&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token language-javascript&quot;&gt; 
location&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;href &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;https://jai-dewani.github.io/resume/resume.pdf&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a GitHub workflow that would move this file to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;gh-pages&lt;/code&gt; with the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; file as well cause this is the file responsible for redirecting the user from &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;github-username&gt;.github.io/resume&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;github-username&gt;.github.io/resume/resume.pdf&lt;/code&gt;. After testing various ways to do the same thing, I have settled on this workflow which compiles all the latex, creates a build folder and moves everything necessary to it, and pushed the build folder to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;gh-pages&lt;/code&gt; branch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;yml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-yml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-yml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Compile and upload résumé PDF

              &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;uses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; JamesIves/github&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;pages&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;deploy&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;action@4.1.4
              &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;BRANCH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; gh&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;pages
                  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;FOLDER&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; build
                  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;CLEAN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean important&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable GitHub pages for &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;gh-pages&lt;/code&gt; to host all the files in that branch on your &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;github-username&gt;.github.io/resume&lt;/code&gt; URL.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now when you share the URL to the repo &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;github-username&gt;.github.io/resume&lt;/code&gt; and it will redirect the person to your resume &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;github-username&gt;.github.io/resume/Resume-&amp;lt;name&gt;.pdf&lt;/code&gt; or you could share the pdf link directly, totally an aesthetic choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some advantages of this are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since you are using a GitHub repository, it should be easy to override the PDF resume, make a commit, push on main branch and the GitHub action would make all the changes required and push them to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;gh-pages&lt;/code&gt; branch&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The URL that you would share for resume will have your GitHub username as well so it would help create a different identity of you compared to most resume links which are just long-ass Google Drive links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I now have a permanent solution to this problem which I personally like will use till I find something even better xD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS: You even connect the main branch of your repo to overleaf after connecting your GitHub to overleaf to update the latex file from overleaf only which provides you an almost live rendered version of your latex and push from there to your repo which would then compile the latex file and push the PDF into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;gh-pages&lt;/code&gt; branch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did I just spend 4 hours solving a problem that takes 10 mins manually? Yes.
and I would do that again if required, every time 😂&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS: You can check out my resume at &lt;a href=&quot;https://jai-dewani.github.io/resume&quot;&gt;https://jai-dewani.github.io/resume&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Update&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am now using iframe to render the pdf on the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;github-username&gt;.github.io/resume&lt;/code&gt; page only, instead of redirecting to the full pdf URL, this was I can skip that ugly redirecting page and the URL looks clean as well. So the new &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; looks like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token doctype&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token doctype-tag&quot;&gt;DOCTYPE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token name&quot;&gt;html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;html&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;lang&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;en&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the people who might be thinking why I haven&apos;t used PDF.js yet is because I think people feel comfortable in whatever PDF engine their browser is using cause, they are used to it by now and I don&apos;t want to introduce javascript to this solution unless it&apos;s really necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do let me know if there is anything I missed out on that we can do to make this workflow more seamless cause the base idea was mine but a lot of small things that you see here were suggested to me by other people&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ronaksakhuja&quot;&gt;@ronaksakhuja&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rajivnayanc&quot;&gt;@rajivnayanc&lt;/a&gt; for sharing their &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ronaksakhuja/resume&quot;&gt;@ronaksakhuja/resume&lt;/a&gt; and &amp;#x3C;private&gt; repositories for giving me an idea, how I can create an action for compiling the latex file to generate the PDF on the fly on every update (makes my life so easy)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/imabp/&quot;&gt;@imabp&lt;/a&gt; gave me the idea to make this a template repository, check out his &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/imabp/resume&quot;&gt;version&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/harshkapadia2/&quot;&gt;@harshkapadia2&lt;/a&gt; for sharing his &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/harshkapadia2/resume&quot;&gt;@harshkapadia2/resume&lt;/a&gt; repository and giving me some ideas on how I can improve my action file and also pointing out that &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/himanshusharma89/&quot;&gt;@himanshusharma89&lt;/a&gt; is using some sort of method to embed his PDF in the HTML view so the mobile users don&apos;t need to download the file just for viewing. CHeckout this repo here &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/himanshusharma89/resume/&quot;&gt;@himanshusharma89/resume&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also that this can easily be done in any language that allows you to execute commands on the terminal. So let&apos;s see how this can be done on the terminal then we will see how we can automate this via python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Open a Terminal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Press &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Win + R&lt;/code&gt; and type &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cmd&lt;/code&gt; in the input box next to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;run: &lt;/code&gt; and press enter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./images/Zero.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Show all the saved profiles in your system&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Type &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;netsh wlan show profiles&lt;/code&gt; and press enter. This should show all the Wifi Profiles saved on your system&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./images/One.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Details about a specific WiFi Profile&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;netsh wlan show profile &amp;lt;profile&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and replacing &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;profile&gt;&lt;/code&gt; with the name of the profile you want to get details about&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./images/Two.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Security key: Present&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Security Settings&lt;/code&gt; Section but it isn&apos;t showing the password. For that, we will have to pass in a parameter of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;key=clear&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So let&apos;s try this again&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;netsh wlan show profile &amp;lt;profile&gt; key=clear&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And voila 🥳🎊 We have the password in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Key Content&lt;/code&gt; Field just below &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Security key: Present&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;./images/Three.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem you can see here is that you will have to run this statement for each WiFi Profile and it might take some time to do this manually. Might just be the difference between you walking away with all passwords or getting caught in the act xD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Now let&apos;s automate this&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose python because I am comfortable with it and have experience with executing instructions on the shell line via python but you can do the same with any language which allows you to execute commands on cmd and the output back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to execute a command on the shell from python&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could have used the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;system()&lt;/code&gt; method of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;os&lt;/code&gt; module but the problem with that is that it runs the commands and prints the output directly on the stdout pipeline and there is no straight way to capture the output in a variable(as far as I know). So I&apos;ll be using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;check_output()&lt;/code&gt; method of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;subprocess&lt;/code&gt; module which takes in a list representing the command and returns the output after running the command as bytes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Running commands and formating output&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s see how we can use this to run &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;netsh wlan show profiles&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;import subprocess
output = subprocess.check_output([&apos;netsh&apos;, &apos;wlan&apos;, &apos;show&apos;, &apos;profiles&apos;]) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if we try printing &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;output&lt;/code&gt;, it should look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;b&apos;\r\nProfiles on interface Wi-Fi:\r\n\r\nGroup policy profiles (read only)\r\n---------------------------------\r\n    &amp;lt;None&gt;\r\n\r\nUser profiles\r\n-------------\r\n    All User Profile     : JioFiber-5G\r\n    All User Profile     : JioFiber\r\n    All User Profile     : Blablabla 2\r\n   
 All User Profile     : Jaya\r\n    All User Profile     : 5G_Home\r\n    All User Profile     : 0E278461867E5885A4F8E790D14D056E 2\r\n    All User Profile     : Jio-2_4G\r\n    All User Profile     : Blablabla\r\n    All User Profile     : Jio5G\r\n    All User Profile     : 0E278461867E5885A4F8E790D14D056E\r\n    All User Profile     : Le pakad\r\n\r\n&apos;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; You might get &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt; only instead of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;/code&gt; depending on which OS you are running this on. This is because DOS and Unix represent linebreak in different ways which are being carried to windows and Linux(why?). This can be a whole blog in itself 😂&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we should decode this string to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;utf-8&lt;/code&gt; and split it into different strings, and extract all the important information, a.k.a. Wifi profiles&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;data = output.decode(&apos;utf-8&apos;).split(&apos;\n&apos;)
profiles = []
for d in data:
    if &quot;All User&quot; in d:
        profiles.append(d.split(&quot;:&quot;)[1].replace(&apos;\r&apos;,&apos;&apos;).strip())&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we should have all the profiles in a nice concise list&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Extracting Passwords for each profile&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All we got to do now is loop over profiles and execute the same command for each profile, format the data and extract what&apos;s important for us. PASSWORDS (insert evil noise)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;gold = [] 
for profile in profiles: 
    command = [&quot;netsh&quot;, &quot;wlan&quot;, &quot;show&quot;, &quot;profile&quot;, profile, &quot;key=clear&quot;]
    output = subprocess.check_output(command)
    data = output.decode(&apos;utf-8&apos;).split(&apos;\n&apos;)
    for d in data:
        if &quot;Key Content&quot; in d:
            password = d.split(&quot;:&quot;)[1].replace(&apos;\r&apos;,&apos;&apos;).strip()
            gold.append([profile,password])&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And at last, drum rolls, please 🥁🥁&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;for g in gold:
    print(&quot;Username: &quot; +g[0] + &quot;\nPassword: &quot; + g[1])
    print(&quot;------------------&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am sorry but I can&apos;t show you my output 😜 but here is a representation of how it should look&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Username: ABCD
Password: password
------------------
Username: Lock
Password: key
------------------
Username: Safe
Password: verysafe
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What you want to copy-paste&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;import subprocess
output = subprocess.check_output([&apos;netsh&apos;, &apos;wlan&apos;, &apos;show&apos;, &apos;profiles&apos;]) 

data = output.decode(&apos;utf-8&apos;).split(&apos;\n&apos;)
profiles = []
for d in data:
    if &quot;All User&quot; in d:
        profiles.append(d.split(&quot;:&quot;)[1].replace(&apos;\r&apos;,&apos;&apos;).strip())

gold = [] 
for profile in profiles: 
    command = [&quot;netsh&quot;, &quot;wlan&quot;, &quot;show&quot;, &quot;profile&quot;, profile, &quot;key=clear&quot;]
    output = subprocess.check_output(command)
    data = output.decode(&apos;utf-8&apos;).split(&apos;\n&apos;)
    for d in data:
        if &quot;Key Content&quot; in d:
            password = d.split(&quot;:&quot;)[1].replace(&apos;\r&apos;,&apos;&apos;).strip()
            gold.append([profile,password])

for g in gold:
    print(&quot;Username: &quot; +g[0] + &quot;\nPassword: &quot; + g[1])
    print(&quot;------------------&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We learned about the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;netsh&lt;/code&gt; command on a shell which can be used to view all saved Wifi profiles and also how we can view information about a specific Wifi profile and we got to know how we can add pass an additional parameter to view the saved password, and at the end, we automated this whole process using python. Remember you can automate using any language with allows you to execute commands on a shell and read the output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Next Step&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideas must be going left and right how you can execute this script on your neighbors and get their wifi and live the rest of your life for free, well ME TOO. So I am thinking of automating this to an extent that this script should infect the system on its own and extract the passwords and then send them to you via mail or an FTP server so that you don&apos;t even need to visit your neighbors.     Covid you know 🤷🏻‍♂😂&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of us tend to ignore the error and use some other character and it works....unless the other character also can&apos;t be used, now it has become frustrating. Let&apos;s get to the bottom of why windows does not allows us &quot;Free Humans&quot; to choose whichever name we want for our folders. After all, it&apos;s not like I am trying to put anything special. : and ? are very common characters in use. Why can&apos;t I name my file &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Why did I do this?&lt;/code&gt; and my folder &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Childhood Images: Don&apos;t open&lt;/code&gt; or my Marvel movies folder &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Marvel &gt; DC&lt;/code&gt; 😤&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Let&apos;s find out&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, most of these restrictions are due to how windows file manager handles filename including other features around them. Hence, these characters are reserved for special purposes, actions, or denote a certain meaning. For example&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Let&apos;s use a backward slash&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;\&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can&apos;t. They are used to access contents inside a certain folder, so windows might confuse my folder &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;to\you&lt;/code&gt; as a folder &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;you&lt;/code&gt; inside a folder &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;to&lt;/code&gt; which is obviously wrong.

&lt;h3&gt;Can I use a colon &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;:&lt;/code&gt; then?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You wish. They are used to denote a drive letter which is usually at the beginning of a file path to tell windows which drive to look into for specific content. Hence having the ability to name a folder &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;E:&lt;/code&gt; can cause problems though technically solving this challenge isn&apos;t hard but maybe windows skipped this to avoid confusion in the mind of users who aren&apos;t very technical but still depend on a computer for critical tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./images/drives.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Drive letters&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;If not backward slash &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;\&lt;/code&gt; then maybe forward slash &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; can be used?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naah, Windows allows users to have shortcuts that can point to a website that might have a forward slash &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;. For example:  &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;https://twitter.com/jai_dewani&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Okay so maybe a question mark &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; or an asterisk&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nope. If allowed it can cause problems because &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; can be used as a wildcard while searching in file explorer. Consider this example where I am searching for all folders that have &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;power&lt;/code&gt; in their name&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./images/search.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;wildcard search in windows explorer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same goes with &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;img src=&quot;./images/star.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Use of asterisk for specific file types&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I love &quot;using&quot; quotes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry for your loss, but quotes are used to refer to file paths that have space in them for example a game inside your Program files will be referred to as &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&quot;C:\Program Files\Epic Games\rocketleague&quot;&lt;/code&gt; due to folders having space in between them. If quotes aren&apos;t used the system can be get confused if the statement is a 3 part command or a single complete path, if there is no space then double quotes aren&apos;t needed.&lt;br&gt;
I can&apos;t say this for sure but windows wanted to keep the system deterministic in a way that the system shouldn&apos;t have to make guesses as to what the user wants it to do, knocking out the possibility to guess if this input is a path to a specific file or a wildcard search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What about less-than &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt; and Greater than &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well they are also used to redirect output to some other file like the command below can redirect the output of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cat a.py&lt;/code&gt; to the file &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;b.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cat a.py &gt; b.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or the same can be run without space in-between&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cat a.py&gt;b.py  &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and having &gt; in files names can cause confusion for windows as to if the user means to redirect the output or this character part of the file name?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;And a lot more&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for which I couldn&apos;t find proper reasons to justify why they aren&apos;t allowed to be used, maybe &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%40jai_dewaani&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; at me if you know any ones I missed that can be included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;But isn&apos;t Windows smart enough?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean Linux and Mac OS allow users to use special characters in file/folder names that might have some other meaning or command attached to them, so why can&apos;t windows do the same? In the end, it comes down to Windows creating a secure environment for their users because having file names as &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;-rf&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;~&lt;/code&gt; can cause huge accidents deliberately or my mistake from the user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fun Fact:&lt;/em&gt; Most of these characters were assigned their special meaning back from MS-DOS and are continued to be supported to date in windows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FullStack Developer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Machine Learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python/C++&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eligibility criteria&lt;/em&gt;: 80%+ in 10th and 12th with 7+ CGPA in B.Tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I applied for the FullStack role as this is my strong point though I was tempted to go for Python/C++ because I love python but didn&apos;t because I don&apos;t know &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;C&lt;/code&gt; about &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;C++&lt;/code&gt; and felt like I would grow more in the FullStack role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the company came in mid-late November only 19 people in total applied and they all were asked to give the First Round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;First Round - Aptitude Test&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It consisted of around 40-45 questions to be solved in 45 Minutes on the Pariksha Platform. You might need some practice beforehand to increase your speed. Almost everyone cleared this round and we were asked to attend the Placement Talk followed by a Technical Test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Second Round - Placement Talk + Technical Test (Coding + MCQs)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were told almost everything one could ask to know about the company, they showed the various fields the company works and various achievements of the company like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Images were taken on the moon during Apollo 11 mission used lenses made by Carl Zeiss.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developing lens to be used by researchers and doctors to do very critical work in their fields&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working on Silicon Technology with companies like Apple&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;...etc, etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were supposed to start the test within 30 minutes after the Placement talk ended. It was conducted on Hackerearch with no camera and no full-screen mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two hours long, it contained 40 MCQ questions based on OS, DBMS, and position specific questions (FullStack and development for me) alongside 3 coding questions of 20, 20, and 50 marks each. Most of the MCQs could be answered in 10-15 seconds if you knew the facts, there wasn&apos;t much heavy calculation to be done. Even after having 90 minutes for 3 coding questions, I was only able to partially solve the 2nd one and but completed the 3rd one fully because it was a standard question which I had solved previously. The other two of 20 points were a bit more mathematical (my weakness :p) hence they ended up eating up a lot of my time with just a partial solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily the situation was the same with everyone else which is why I was able to move into the next round. A total of 16 people out of 19 were selected for the next round (Quite a good amount).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Third Round: Technical Interview&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technical Interview was taken by two members (say A and B, A was junior to B), though most of the questions were asked by the A and B was just there probably analyzing my answers and behavior.&lt;br&gt;
They outright asked me what things I know so I told them JavaScript, Node, and Python (+ Django).
They asked me one simple coding question, if you are close or above to 1700 in CodeChef then you don&apos;t need to worry in this section. The part which had me sweating is when they started asking a specific question regarding JavaScript like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does JS support asynchronous nature being a single-threaded language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Difference between == and ===&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How JS stores data and datatypes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and more which I can&apos;t remember :p&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was able to answer most questions with confidence and ended the interview by asking some questions from my side about the workstyle, technologies used, and how work from home is affecting them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fourth Round: HR Interview&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was supposed to happen at least an hour after my third interview ended so I left my laptop and phone to take a stroll and coming back after 15 minutes I see 3 missed calls and a message from HR to call him back. So I did and he asked if we could do the HR round in 5 minutes and we jumped on to a video call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was mostly just a confirmation call that yes you have been selected and some random question here and there about my family and how many brothers and sisters I have. After which it was mostly me asking questions and discussing how the internship will take place, their views on PPO opportunity and If we will be given any task or things to learn before the joining date (&amp;#x26; more similar questions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Just a tip&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I can recommend after this is that make sure to ask as many questions related to work-life and how the whole internship will take place or even ask about them about what they do (make sure to ask this in the tone) because everyone loves to talk about themselves whoever it might be.   Asking a lot of questions even though you &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; know the answers reduces unknown variables and will make the recruiters confident in deciding to hire you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, 6 people got to the HR round and 5 were selected for a 6-month internship opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FullStack: 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Machine Learning: 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python/C++: 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;PS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am hoping to document my internship in form of blogs every 1-2 week describing the kind of work I did and the new things I am learning because I as a fresher I was always interested in knowing what kind of work people did and how they approach problem working in a company. Hence I am starting a newsletter so that people can follow my journey and if it even helps even one person, it will be worth all the work. &lt;strong&gt;Consider subscribing to my newsletter&lt;/strong&gt; and I&apos;ll try to share any new blogs that I end up writing too.&lt;/p&gt;

Don&apos;t worry. Then this JS script got you covered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s get over what we are going to do, We are going to use Developer Console to inject some script into WhatsApp Web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;🕸 WhatsApp Web&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open WhatsApp web and make sure the chat which your bot is supposed to spam is opened on the center-right screen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;💻 Developer Console&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either search for &lt;strong&gt;Developer Tools&lt;/strong&gt; in the drop-down menu in any browser or use the shortcut &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Ctrl + Shift + I&lt;/code&gt; and move to the &lt;strong&gt;Console tab&lt;/strong&gt; where we can write Javascript and interact with the DOM (Document Object Model).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;✍️ Enter some text in the message box&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are going to use CSS selectors to select a specific section of the web page and then use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;document.querySelector()&lt;/code&gt; to get the DOM object of that section. Let&apos;s select the input area object and store it in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;textbox&lt;/code&gt; variable&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;var textpath = &apos;#main &gt; footer &gt; div._3SvgF._1mHgA.copyable-area &gt; div.DuUXI &gt; div &gt; div._1awRl.copyable-text.selectable-text&apos;;
var textbox = document.querySelector(textpath);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now type something directly in the message box, and enter &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;textbox.textContent&lt;/code&gt; into the console and it should return the same text, let&apos;s try setting some text via the Developer Console instead of directly typing it in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;textbox.textContent = &quot;Some Text&quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same text must be updated in the WhatsApp web GUI. Yaay, we hare halfway done&lt;/p&gt;

        decoding=&quot;async&quot;
      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but there is a problem, we have the record button where the send button is supposed to be. That&apos;s because we have changed the state of the message box internally but the input needs to know that something has been typed on it to update the mic button to the send button. Let&apos;s do this by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;window.InputEvent = window.Event || window.InputEvent
var event = new InputEvent(&apos;input&apos;, {bubbles: true});
textbox.dispatchEvent(event);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the send button is visible&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span
      class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot;
      style=&quot;position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 800px; &quot;

        decoding=&quot;async&quot;
      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;⏩ Send the message&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that is left is to select the send button and send a click signal to let it know the message is read to be sent. Let&apos;s do this by first selecting the send button and then by calling the click method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;var buttonpath = &apos;#main &gt; footer &gt; div._3SvgF._1mHgA.copyable-area &gt; div:nth-child(3) &gt; button&apos;;
var b = document.querySelectorAll(buttonpath)[0]
b.click();&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;🎉 Congratulations, You have now automated the process of sending one message. Lets try to send more&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One easy way is to just run this whole code in a loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;var i = 0;
for(i=0;i&amp;lt;10;i++){
    var textpath = &apos;#main &gt; footer &gt; div._3SvgF._1mHgA.copyable-area &gt; div.DuUXI &gt; div &gt; div._1awRl.copyable-text.selectable-text&apos;;
    var textbox = document.querySelector(textpath);
    textbox.textContent = &quot;Some Text&quot;;

    window.InputEvent = window.Event || window.InputEvent;
    var event = new InputEvent(&apos;input&apos;, {bubbles: true});
    textbox.dispatchEvent(event);
    
    var buttonpath = &apos;#main &gt; footer &gt; div._3SvgF._1mHgA.copyable-area &gt; div:nth-child(3) &gt; button&apos;;
    var b = document.querySelectorAll(buttonpath)[0]
    b.click();
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all great but let&apos;s make this code bit more general by allowing the user to select the text and number of repetitions at runtime. This can be done by taking input from the user using a prompt similar to an alert box. In the end, the code should look something like this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;var message = prompt(&quot;Enter the message&quot;);
var count = prompt(&quot;Enter the Number of times&quot;); // Change the Number to change 
var looper = 0;
for(looper=0;looper&amp;lt;count;looper++)
{
    window.InputEvent = window.Event || window.InputEvent;
    var d = new Date();
    var event = new InputEvent(&apos;input&apos;, {bubbles: true});
    var textbox= document.querySelector(&apos;#main &gt; footer &gt; div.vR1LG._3wXwX.copyable-area &gt; div._2A8P4 &gt; div &gt; div._2_1wd.copyable-text.selectable-text&apos;);
    
    textbox.textContent = message;
    textbox.dispatchEvent(event);
    var b = document.querySelectorAll(&apos;#main &gt; footer &gt; div.vR1LG._3wXwX.copyable-area &gt; div:nth-child(3) &gt; button&apos;)[0]
    b.click();
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the user can enter the message the loop count in alert boxes and the result should look something like this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;images/repeat.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;🐾 Extra bit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just the starting, you can customize this script in several ways to do different tasks like how I change a few things so now this script takes in a message and sends each word as a separate message, just because I hate when people do this to me. Why can&apos;t you people send the whole message together? -_-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;var message = prompt(&quot;Enter the message&quot;);
var message = message.split(&apos; &apos;);
var looper = 0;
for(looper=0;looper&amp;lt;message.length;looper++)
{
    window.InputEvent = window.Event || window.InputEvent;
    var d = new Date();
    var event = new InputEvent(&apos;input&apos;, {bubbles: true});
    var textbox= document.querySelector(&apos;#main &gt; footer &gt; div.vR1LG._3wXwX.copyable-area &gt; div._2A8P4 &gt; div &gt; div._2_1wd.copyable-text.selectable-text&apos;);
    
    textbox.textContent = message[looper];
    textbox.dispatchEvent(event);
    var b = document.querySelectorAll(&apos;#main &gt; footer &gt; div.vR1LG._3wXwX.copyable-area &gt; div:nth-child(3) &gt; button&apos;)[0]
    b.click();

These new formats came with new extensions DOC&lt;strong&gt;X&lt;/strong&gt;, PPT&lt;strong&gt;X&lt;/strong&gt;, XLS&lt;strong&gt;X&lt;/strong&gt;, etc where &lt;strong&gt;X&lt;/strong&gt; stands for XML and allows this format to be more open and accessible, allowing this format to be parsed and understood by any other software that wishes to parse it and with this DOCX is the most used and popular standard. The same goes for other Microsoft formats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since all Microsoft formats are ZIP files that contain everything in XML format, all blob elements like Images, Videos and Audio are stored as it is in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;/media&lt;/code&gt; folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extensions are just a fancy codeword for your operating system to help him understand how to handle a file, to open it in MS Word or MS Powerpoint. The actual file type is determined by the Signature of files (magic number) which is a sequence of bytes present in the header which is unique for each file type &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures&quot;&gt;List of file signatures&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talk is cheap, Show me the code&lt;/strong&gt; - Linus Torvalds&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blogs/1078f286fae9c0c03c9a7c87a361f419/good-stuff.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;See it for yourself&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open your Docx, Pptx, or any MS Office file in a text editor which should display it in hexadecimal format. Look up the first 4 bytes (8 characters) which should be &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;504b 0304&lt;/code&gt; and lookup the &lt;a href=&quot;https://filesignatures.net/index.php?page=search&amp;#x26;search=ZIP&amp;#x26;mode=EXT&quot;&gt;Signature of Zip files&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;They both match!&lt;/strong&gt; Hence internally both the files are the same, the only difference is caused by the OS assigning different software to open a file depending on the extension at the end of the filename.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./images/text-file.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enough analyzing, let&apos;s get inside this mess!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Let&apos;s Hack Microsoft Office files!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blogs/39c7d4f3a2863cb1e53c117df339538a/hacking.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open any Zip Programs like 7-Zip or WinZip and select an MS Office file and choose &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Extract to&lt;/code&gt; and select the location where you want to unzip the file.
&lt;img src=&quot;images/unzip.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How Media is stored in MS Office files&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes this new format open is that the images, videos, and anything media are stored as it is in the media folder as visible in the folder structure below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes this even better is that all the text and meta-information is stored in XML format which can be ready openly and parsed easily after understanding the format of XML which is universal for each MS Office file. &lt;strong&gt;Just copy and paste all the media and your work is done!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;images/folder.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Extra bits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of files that use the same technique of hiding their data behind a zipped file with extensions to let the OS know how to handle the file in execution like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;aar, apk - Android application archive files, create when App Installer files are generated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;epub - An ebook file format&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ipa - It is an iOS application archive file, used to distribute installable apps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;jar - An archive of Java class files and metadata into one package for easy distribution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;kmz - Used for expressing geographic annotation and visualization within two-dimensional maps and three-dimensional Earth browsers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;maff - Mozilla Archive format, used to store all the contents of a webpage in a ZIP file for ease of management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;odp, ods, odt - Used by office suites like OpenOffice and LibreOffice. Text documents (. odt), as well as spreadsheets (. ods) and also presentations (. odp).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever saw CTC of around 40-50 Lakhs with a base of 12-15 Lakhs and wondered where are the rest of 30-35 Lakhs? Yeah, me too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yes, these numbers are from an actual company that exists on this earth! So here I will try my best to uncover what all goes to boost a 12-15 Lakh base to 40-50 Lakh CTC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone looking for colleges, especially for Computer Science focuses a lot on placement stats. What were the average packages provided, the companies which visited, and the highest packages provided? Not often but we would see these huge packages of 50 LPA and instantly start dividing it by 12 and thinking 4 Lakhs per month....daaam 😍 We all did this, didn&apos;t we? 😓&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let&apos;s understand what is CTC. It means Cost to Company, so basically, the amount of company is going to spend on you, which can be in various ways like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health Care&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life Insurance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food expenses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Company Shares&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Travel Cost&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonus (usually a year-end bonus, may depend on your performance)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joining bonus (mostly one time)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relocation Bonus (mostly one time)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the amount that will be actually sent to your bank account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now there are a lot of fine print when it comes to the total CTC, some recurring ones are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus:&lt;/strong&gt; In simple terms bonus incudes the extra money you will get at the year-end. There is various way of mentioning this in CTC, some of the most common ones are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Direct Bonus: This directly mentions the bonus you&apos;ll get at the year-end&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Performance-Based Bonus: A minimum bonus will be mentioned but you can get more than this if you perform well. A lot of companies are using this strategy to hype their employees to perform well. In my opinion, this is a good measure to keep employees from slacking off&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;X Bonux Vested in 4 years: This means the bonus will be divided into 4 years and X/4 amount will be given to you at the end of each year, mentioning the bonus of 4 years and adding it to CTC which is supposed to represent the cost of one year isn&apos;t a good practice in my opinion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Company Shares:&lt;/strong&gt; Companies have started providing their shares to employees to make them feel responsible and take initiative. Shares can be provided in two forms&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exact amount: Say 1000 shares, so the company will give you 1000 of there shares&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amount of shares: The company will give you there shares that are worth that much amount at this point in time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of shares written in CTC is usually the combined worth of 4 years, which will be provided to you equally say 25% per year but companies tend to divide the share in an un-even fashion (like &lt;em&gt;10%, 15%, 25%, 50%&lt;/em&gt;) to force employes to stay for at least 4 years allowing there shares mature. Aside from the uneven division what needs to be focused on is that the total amount of 4 years worth of shares is included in CTC which is supposed to represent the cost of each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of Big Engineering companies are following these methods of hyping up the CTC even if it doesn&apos;t represent the actual amount you will receive in a year which has lead the small startups/companies to do the same because in the end not a lot of people look behind the CTC in the first view which has become the main attraction point for attracting new Developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joining Bonus and Relocation Bonus:&lt;/strong&gt; You will usually get this amount just once when you join the company and will not be present in your second year so technically your gross salary will decrease in the second year. How great is that, right?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, what we need to realize is that the CTC we all see and crave is the entire story. I am including a very informative answer by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaustav-mukherjee-17547751/?originalSubdomain=in&quot;&gt;Kaustav Mukherjee&lt;/a&gt; who works at Microsoft on quora about &lt;a href=&quot;https://qr.ae/pNWkzn&quot;&gt;CTC Breakdown of Microsft and more.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Hence I tend to stick to what I am comfortable with, I think the same applies to a lot of us 😜, doesn&apos;t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, I am not here to discuss how many of us hesitate to use debugging tools because neither do I 😝 but there is something we all can do to improve our debugging skills. I was surprised to know that there are more methods in the console object than just log(). Here I will try to go through some of them with some examples and hope you will start using at least one or two of these news ones because some of them can be life changing :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Console.log()&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know this one very well, don&apos;t we :p. Our old friend who can print out any message we pass into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Console.dir()&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dir() method can print a list of properties of the javascript object that has been passed into it. At first dir() and log() might seem a lot similar but there is a huge difference between both of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Console.log() vs Console.dir()&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In theoretical words, everything in javascript is represented as an object even a string. So when we console.log something it is first stringified whereas console.dir() prints the object as a JSON with all its properties and methods.
Here is an example illustrating the difference between them&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Console.table()&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The table() method will print everything in a table format (except numbers and strings because they don&apos;t need a table 😝). The table also provides a lot of the option of an excel sheet, like sorting data in ascending or descending for any column. It not only supports arrays of any dimension but all sorts of objects and the clear visibility it provides in tabular form can be very helpful when working with large objects/data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./images/table.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Console.table&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Console.trace()&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like any other error trace you must have seen, the trace() method can print out a complete trace to the console. You can pass in any object or even a custom message which will be printed out similar to a console.log() but along with it will be a trace of calls that lead to the execution of that statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a good tool say when working on a project where the same function is being used in a lot of places and you want to know which part of your project is making a bad call to that function causing problems and sleepless nights :) The call trace can be very helpful in similar cases and for the internal development process&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./images/trace.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Console.trace&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Console.assert(assertion,message)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assert() method logs out an error if the expression passed inside it evaluates to false but won&apos;t log anything if the expression evaluates to true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can be very helpful when working with a big project where you don&apos;t want every function to log into the console especially when they run properly, you just want them to log out errors when there is a problem. So assert can be used while checking some condition and on failure, it will start logging out the whole state so the debugging process can be streamlined&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: This blog is for educational purpose only&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Aim of the project&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow our users to search for a specific youtube&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Display the list of videos with thumbnail and test corresponding to the search query&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide a button to download the video&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets begin with installing &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/en/&quot;&gt;Node&lt;/a&gt;, I&apos;ll recommend installing the recommended version. Npm comes preinstalled with Node which will help us to install 3rd party packages we need to build this project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Initialize a node project&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm init&lt;/code&gt; to initialize a node project. You will be prompted to fill out some fields which will be reflected in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt;, you can enter the information or just press enter to skip as you can always change these fields manually in &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt;. The output should look something like this (package name depending on your root folder name)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
It only covers the &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;most&lt;/span&gt; common items and tries to guess sensible defaults.

See &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;npm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;help&lt;/span&gt; init&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; definitive documentation on these fields
and exactly what they do.

Use &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;npm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;pkg&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; afterward to &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; a package and
save it as a dependency &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; the package.json file.

Press ^C at any &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;time&lt;/span&gt; to quit.
package name: &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;trial&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
version: &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1.0&lt;/span&gt;.0&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
description: A &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;test&lt;/span&gt; project
entry point: &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;index.js&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;test&lt;/span&gt; command:

&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;name&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;trial&quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
  &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;version&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;1.0.0&quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
  &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;description&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;A test project&quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
  &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;main&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;index.js&quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
  &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;scripts&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;test&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;echo &lt;span class=&quot;token entity&quot; title=&quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;\&quot;&lt;/span&gt;Error: no test specified&lt;span class=&quot;token entity&quot; title=&quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;\&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; exit 1&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;,
  &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;author&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
  &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;license&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;ISC&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Installing all the required libraries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a new folder and open your terminal in this new folder, and start installing these libraries one by one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;body-parser&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm install body-parser&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
body-parser is a middleware for parsing request body to easily access the information sent by the user via POST method in this application&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;dotenv&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm install dotenv&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It&apos;s a package that loads environment variables from a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; file into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;process.env&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;ejs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm install ejs&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Ejs is a dynamic rendering template that will be used to render dynamic data to show different videos depending on the search result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;express&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm install express&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It&apos;s a framework for Node to ease the development of end-points/APIs while working with node&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;request&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm install request&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Request will be used to make HTTP requests to get information from APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;youtube-dl&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm install youtube-dl&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It&apos;s the core library that allows us to download videos from youtube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Or Install all of them in one command&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm install body-parser dotenv ejs express request youtube-dl&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Pretty neat, huuh?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Creating a Youtube Data API v3 Key and setting up .env&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This API will be used to get a list of videos from youtube when the user searches for one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library/youtube.googleapis.com&quot;&gt;Google APIs&lt;/a&gt; and Enable Youtube Data API v3 for a project to use it for searching&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You should see a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Manage&lt;/code&gt; button after enabling the API, click on it, and create a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Credential&lt;/code&gt; which we will save in a .env file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; file that will be used to store all the credentials and things you shouldn&apos;t have directly on your codebase. The directory should now look something like this:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
├── .env
└── package.json&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;/.env&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Store your API Credentials in &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; something like this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;APICREDENTIAL=your-key-here&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Creating index.js and a home page to search for videos&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create an index.js after which your directory should look something like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
├── index.js
├── .env
└── package.json&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;/index.js | Import all the libraries needed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; express &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;express&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; app &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; request &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;request&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Lets try running our project and see how it looks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running a node.js project is very simple, just run the following commands on the terminal at the root of your project directory&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;node&lt;/span&gt; index.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now go to your browser and open &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;localhost:8080&lt;/code&gt; and hopefully you&apos;ll see something like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./images/index.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Index page&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure that you close the server by pressing &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Ctrl + C&lt;/code&gt; and restart it to any changes you make on &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;index.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Creating a Search Route&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;/index.js&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Youtube-dl allows us to create an object which has many functions to be attached to Event names emitted by the object. We here are using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;video.on(&apos;info&apos;)&lt;/code&gt; which is executed when the video object receives an &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;info&lt;/code&gt; signal from youtube.
Inside which we are saving &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;track&lt;/code&gt; and starting a download using &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;video.pipe(fs.createWriteStream(track));&lt;/code&gt; while using node&apos;s standard file system &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;fs&lt;/code&gt; library. Since the video is going to be a stream of data which is why we have used &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;fs.createWriteStream(track)&lt;/code&gt; with the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;track&lt;/code&gt; as the file name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra route is to be redirected after you click the download button to a &quot;Downloaded Successfully&quot; page. But now we have to create this page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;views/started.ejs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ejs&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ejs&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ejs&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token ejs language-ejs&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token delimiter punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;%-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token language-javascript&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;./partials/header&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token delimiter punctuation&quot;&gt;%&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Your download has started!&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;h2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

        In the meanwhile, you can go back for more downloads

&lt;h2&gt;Done! Let&apos;s try downloading some videos&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run your Node server, try searching something, and click on download.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;Notice something weird?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The file is being downloaded in your project folder and not in your download location! You might have guessed it, but if not this is because of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cwd&lt;/code&gt;, which we assigned as &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;__dirname&lt;/code&gt; while setting up the project which takes the current location of the file which is index.js in your current directory. Good that we were able to find this problem, maybe I&apos;ll set my download folder in &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cwd&lt;/code&gt;. This should solve my problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is another problem, after clicking the download button I don&apos;t get a prompt in my browser about a file downloading. Can you guess why is that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thinking&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&apos;s because you aren&apos;t sending the file to the user, it&apos;s just being downloading in the backend which luckily is your system in this case so can access this download, but this won&apos;t work when you want to host this solution and let users download youtube videos in their system. It will just keep downloading the files on the server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Allow userside downloads&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;index.js&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is require just about 10 lines of changes in your &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;download/&amp;lt;video-url&gt;&lt;/code&gt; route&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;app&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;/download/:videoUrl&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;req&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major changes are that in &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;video.on(&apos;info&apos;,)&lt;/code&gt; we are just writing the head of our response with the file-type, name, and length. And we have added &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;video.on(&apos;data&apos;)&lt;/code&gt; which is where we are taking the stream of data from youtube and sending to the user via &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;res&lt;/code&gt; while closing the connection when the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;video.on(&apos;end&apos;)&lt;/code&gt; prompt is received to our &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;video&lt;/code&gt; object&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Finally Done! I promise it&apos;s done&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&apos;t trust me? Turn on your server and start downloading, make sure to remember the Youtube Data API is free up to a limit so it won&apos;t be profitable to turning to host this for everyone unless the access is restricted to a group of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Done? Naah, there are so much more that can be one&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;contains-task-list&quot;&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; Allow for a video option of quality to chose while downloading a video&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; Add feature to download whole playlists in a single click&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; Allow users to directly submit a youtube video URL instead of searching to download videos&lt;/li&gt;

Hence the first step before doing any analysis is to convert them to CSV format yet there isn&apos;t a standard or a simplified way to do so, hence I am sharing what I have scavenged from the web while doing my project which was Implimenting the paper &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.02656.pdf&quot;&gt;Deep Packet: A Novel Approach For Encrypted Traffic Classification Using Deep Learning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This method has been tested on Ubuntu and should work on any other linux platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Install argus via terminal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;sudo apt-get install argus-client&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Convert .pcap to .argus file format&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;argus -r filename.pcap -w filename.argus&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
-r &amp;#x3C;FILE&gt; Read FILE&lt;br&gt;
-w &amp;#x3C;FILE&gt; Write FILE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Convert .argus to .csv file forrmat while choosing which features to extract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ra -r filename.argus -u -s &amp;lt;features-comma-seprated&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ra -r filename.argus -u -s rank, stime, ltime, dur&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-r &amp;#x3C;FILE&gt; Read FILE&lt;br&gt;
-u Print time values using Unix time format (seconds from the Epoch).&lt;br&gt;
-s Specify the fields to print.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list of available fields to print can be found &lt;a href=&quot;http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/man1/ra.1.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. After selecting your required set of fields this indeed is a very short and effective way of converting .pcap to .csv for further analysis which in my case was Deep Learning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps you :)&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[New .URL powered shortcuts to access the web quickly]]></title><description><![CDATA[The .new domain was first noticed when google allowed people to quickly open a new doc by typing doc.new after which they started the…]]></description><link>https://jai-dewani.github.io/blogs/new-urls/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jai-dewani.github.io/blogs/new-urls/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 29 Sep 2020 02:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The .new domain was first noticed when google allowed people to quickly open a new doc by typing &lt;a href=&quot;http://doc.new&quot;&gt;doc.new&lt;/a&gt; after which they started the process of opening its .new-powered shortcuts to other companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://slides.new&quot;&gt;slides.new&lt;/a&gt;: Create a new Google slide presentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://forms.new&quot;&gt;forms.new&lt;/a&gt;: Create a new  Google form&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://react.new&quot;&gt;react.new&lt;/a&gt;: Create a new  React codesandbox&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://vue.new&quot;&gt;vue.new&lt;/a&gt;: Create a new  Vue codesandbox&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ng.new&quot;&gt;ng.new&lt;/a&gt;: Create a new Angular codesandbox&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Express came to our campus in the second-third week of September for the following job roles&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data Analysis &amp;#x26; Stewardship&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Product Management &amp;#x26; Development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Business Insights &amp;#x26; Analytics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were asked to provide our order of preference, mine was 2,1,3 because I wanted an SDE centric role and also I am the last person you should come for business Insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First Round: Resume Shortlisting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;25 of us got into the next round. Don&apos;t ask me why? how? Like they every tell :p&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second Round: Coding + Aptitude Test&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a 45+30 minute test on mettl with full screen on but no camera, 30 minutes for 2 coding questions which were mostly easy based on string or arrays. Didn&apos;t even need to write the best optimal solution O(nlogn), instead, O(n^2) worked in one of the questions. The Aptitude section required a very fast solving and response rate, 60 questions in 45 minutes with +1 and -0.25 (throwback to JEE)! Out of 60, around 40 were general aptitude whereas the last 20 were related to theoretical computer science, the output of C, Java programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note:&lt;/em&gt; We could have attempted both (coding + aptitude) of the section in any other, but couldn&apos;t skip from one to another and expect to go back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I went first with the coding section, solved both of them in 15 minutes, stretched my hands for the next 5 minutes (it was going to be one hell of a ride)! Some questions were just made long out just to waste our time, so I skipped anything which has a long question statement or I wasn&apos;t comfortable with the topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, I solved around 50-55 of them (don&apos;t know how many were right :p) and got selected for the next round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third Round: Pre-Placement Round&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you must ask me, shouldn&apos;t pre-placement happen before any selection round takes place? Also pre-placement ROUND? Shouldn&apos;t it just be a webinar?&lt;br&gt;
Yes, I was here just a week ago. They got all the selected students from 6 colleges and put into a webinar expecting us to interact and answer questions and ask our doubts and somehow they will select the next round of student.....pretty new for me too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legend has that no one knows how they did it, but I got selected so little did I cared at that moment? :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fourth Round: Interviews&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were 3 interviews, I only got till the 2nd one, and here is my experience &amp;#x26; views after discussing with other members&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Round one: Technical Interview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A panel of two took my interview asking me technical questions in the following order,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About yourself: Told them about what I have done in the past 3 years, things I have learned, and my work experience&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Projects: Spent a lot of time discussing my projects listed in my resume, they told me to talk about the project so I told them about a Competitive-programming platform I build, had some good discussion about it, and my other projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Short: They care about your motive as much as they do about the tech, keep a good story about why you build a project, could touch upon a need you faced or some problem you noticed in day to day life and not &lt;em&gt;I find this tech cool, hence I build it&lt;/em&gt;. Having a good project is as important as a good story around it and good presentation skills!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Puzzles: They asked me a puzzle on probability, my brain goes brrrrrrrrrrr....&lt;em&gt;dead&lt;/em&gt;. RIP. Then asked an easy problem out of pity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Puzzle 1:&lt;/em&gt; A man has 53 socks in his drawer: 21 identical blue, 15 identical black, and 17 identical red. The lights are fused and he is completely in the dark. How many socks must he take out to make 100 percent certain he has a pair of black socks?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Puzzle 2:&lt;/em&gt; A car travels the first half of a motorway journey at an average speed of 40 mph, and the second half of the journey at an average speed of 60 mph. What is the average speed for the entire journey?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coding: Asked me if I know about the Fibonacci series and then asked me to code it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;def fib(n):
    fib_arr = [0,1] 
    for i in range(n-2): 
        temp = fib_arr[-1] + fib_arr[-2]
        fib_arr.append(temp)
    return fib_arr&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look closely, it will return [0,1] for n=1 which is wrong, so I corrected it after it was pointed out to me by adding&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;    if n==1:
        return [0]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I was asked what all languages are you comfortable with other than Python, I said C and JavaScript. They asked me if I write this function in C what problem will you face? I was supposed to answer that integers in C can face Overflow problems with big numbers but my mind was already going brrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.......&lt;em&gt;dead&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this, they asked me to do the same without using an array which I easily did. Then I was asked how good I was in python and then questions on python syntax:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are Decorators, generators, yield, pass, and continue?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After which I was taken into the DSA section with the following questions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Difference between Binary Tree and Binary Search Tree?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you know any self-balancing tree? How do they self balance themselves?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have a sorted link list you need to find a specific number in the list in an optimal way, you are given a function which can return value at any index.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I was asked what all subjects I have studied during my college, I replied some of them are OS, DBMS, and &lt;strong&gt;Big Data&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Even after my strong emphasis on &lt;em&gt;Big Data&lt;/em&gt; I was asked questions on OS.....oh my darn luck!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Difference between multitasking, multithreading, multiprocessing?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mutex and Semaphore&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then some question based on Amex&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What Amex does?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How credit cards work and how Amex earns money?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And thus my first interview ended, 6 out 8 of us got into the next round&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Round two: Tech + HR&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this interview We mostly discussed my resume, work experience, and two of my four projects in my resume, I assumed certain things while explaining my first one which must have had its negative impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than this I was asked a SQL question where there is some data in table A and a subset of it in table B with additional information in other columns that aren&apos;t in table A. How will you print all the data from both tables A &amp;#x26; B?
Ans: Left Join&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the regular, &lt;em&gt;Why Amex?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Round three: Missed it :\&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Couldn&apos;t qualify for this round. PS: This was the last round.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Interviews are FUN]]></title><description><![CDATA[Photo by Jonathan Borba on Unsplash This is me sharing a 40-minute interview experience that I had on the day of writing this article for an…]]></description><link>https://jai-dewani.github.io/blogs/Interviews-are-fun/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jai-dewani.github.io/blogs/Interviews-are-fun/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 02 Sep 2020 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is me sharing a 40-minute interview experience that I had on the day of writing this article for an internship at a development position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After it completed, at first I didn&apos;t have any views of my own about how the interview was, yeah it went well but I didn&apos;t think if the questions asked and the discussions we had were good or not until I started writing a small tweet which soon overgrew to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jai_dewani/status/1300891993380253697&quot;&gt;thread of 5 tweets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is my full experience (as much as my forgetful mind can remember)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got finally got a call 15 minutes after the timing of the schedule at which point I had lost most of my anxiety compared to when I was expecting the call. We started with a traditional &quot;tell me something about yourself&quot;. After some few basic points on where I study and whatnot, I started discussing the technologies I have worked on mostly Django and Node.js.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explained my project &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jai-dewani/Lab-Works&quot;&gt;lab works&lt;/a&gt; and the tech stack which was HTML, CSS, JS for frontend and Django + SQLite for backend + database. Then explained my second project &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jai-dewani/Lab-Works&quot;&gt;Yelp Camp&lt;/a&gt; and the tech stack which was HTML, CSS, Js, Node.js, Express, Passport, MongoDB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got rammed in the DBMS section when he asked when would you use an RDBMS, non-RDBMS or Redis. Made wild guess that RDBMS is good for a lot of queries whereas non-RDBMS is good for non-structured data and flexibility. Need to work on my DBMS skills&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main issue raised was that I have no previous experience with even a single thing in the tech stack this company uses so I was asked to give some example where I picked up a technology pretty quickly and implemented something in it. I shared my experience in React which I had been using for less than a month and all the things I have learned in this month itself!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this we dive into the world of Js, went from simple express to routers and what are they used for, what are async and callbacks, how do they work. Had a pretty long discussion about the event loop and how it works, though I wasn&apos;t able to answer what kind of data structure it uses, I made a wild guess of the queue because I remembered this talk form &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ&quot;&gt;JSConf in 2014&lt;/a&gt; and somehow remembered only the callback queue and not the call stack :facepalm:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At last, somehow we ended up in Kubernetes land which is an unexplored territory for me but he assured me that he just wants to know how much I know and doesn&apos;t expect a perfect example. I explained(guessed) how Dockers might work like a package.json file for a Node.js/React project which helps in setting up a project in a new machine very easy with the help of just 2-3 commands!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I loved about this interview is that he just asked me one question about something, took some tools and technologies or jargons as we like to call then and asked me more about them until he reached the limit of my knowledge. At times when I told him that I have no experience of some specific conditions like a routeing clash in express he asked me to just answer as if I am creating this package and how would I like this to work in &quot;my package&quot;, this I think says a lot about a person than it should :p after all while working in a company we all have to follow some standards, better to have the same idealogy in the first place than to make a hard-fast rule of following them against the natural will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major Key Takeaways from this interview according to me are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gave an interview for a startup and it was a good experience, giving an interview after a whole year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a development role and I wasn&apos;t even asked a single DSA problem but instead, we discussed some technologies I was good at and how I think or make guesses :P&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We discussed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;my projects on Django and Node.js&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how fast can I take on new technologies since I had no experience with what they were using&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was evaluated on my JS skills and some good DBMS questions like &quot;When to use RDBMS and non-RDBMS&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interviewer was the pretty experience with JS so he went as far as to ask what is an event loop and what kind of data structure it uses?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He did not know Django and asked me to explain Django to him like he is a noobie, which I think is a good exercise!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I learned from the interviewer&apos;s point of view was that he didn&apos;t come prepared with a specific set of questions. He just went with the flow and asked whatever he thought would help him understand me a little better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps others especially the interviewers.....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn&apos;t have asked for a better grading of my knowledge ranging from
- what I know,
- how strong are my concepts
- how fast am I in learning because you have to keep on learning to survive&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hosting my Flask and Streamlit application on free tier Heroku]]></title><description><![CDATA[In this blog I will be covering the steps I took to host my project 'DeepNeuralNetwork' on Heroku.

I used Flask to power a keras model and serve its output as an API which I consumed using streamlit while create responsive, fast and clean UI&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;A bit about Heroku&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everying in Heroku is an &lt;strong&gt;app&lt;/strong&gt; which can be deoployed to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.heroku.com/dynos&quot;&gt;dyons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; which are basically light weight linux containers which can host your app It uses container-based architecture to host apps, which means you can easily scale up your apps by increase the number of containers to balance out the load!&lt;br&gt;
When you sign up with Heroku, you automatically get some free dyno hours, a sort of currency which can be used to run your apps in dynos. When your app runs, it consumes dyno hours. And when your app is idle for 30 minutes or more it automatically sleeps to stop consuming dyno hours. Don&apos;t worry it will take up automatically if you give it any task to do (might take a few seconds to warm up)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also provide a free tier service and its main features are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;550 Hours of dyno hours per month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After adding a credit card you will get +450 hours per month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your monthly dyno hours can be shared by two or more apps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 dyno per app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;512 MB ram per dyno, which will be used to load all the extra packages you will be installing (This information will be useful afterwards).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upto 5 free apps (without credit card) or 100 (with credit card)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&apos;ll be referring terminal on Linux/Mac and cmd on windows as terminal, so that is easy for me&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Setting up Heroku CLI&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am assuming that you have made an account on Heroku.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before starting any sort of deployment you need to setup Heroku cli to be able to push your code directly to Heroku from &lt;a href=&quot;https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; after downloading and installing Heroku cli, open your terminal/cmd and type&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;heroku login&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which should promote you to login to Heroku on a browser, after successfully loging in you shoud something like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Logging in... done
Logged in as me@example.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;on your terminal. This means you have completed the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; step of learning to host on Heroku&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Hosting flask + keras model&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will mainly need the following files to host your application on Heroku&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;app.py (core logic of your app)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Procfile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;runtime.txt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;requirements.txt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After which you will have to do the following steps&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create an Heroku app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pushing your code to Heroku&apos;s server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Create your flask app&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mine loads a pre-trained model using a .h5 file and serves its outputs over an API. All the code snipits in this section are part of a same file &lt;em&gt;app.py&lt;/em&gt; in the order given bellow&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Importing all the necessary stuff&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;import json
import tensorflow as tf 
import numpy as np 
import random 
from flask import Flask, request&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loading my pre-trained MNSIT model from &lt;em&gt;model.h5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;model = tf.keras.models.load_model(&apos;model.h5&apos;)
feature_model = tf.keras.models.Model(
	model.inputs,
	[layer.output for layer in model.layers]
)
_, (x_test, _ ) = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()
x_test = x_test/255
def get_prediction():
	index = np.random.choice(x_test.shape[0])
	image = x_test[index, :, :]
	image_arr = np.reshape(image, (1, 784))
	return feature_model.predict(image_arr), image&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using flask to create a API which serves values from each node of different layers in my model&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;app = Flask(__name__)
@app.route(&apos;/&apos;, methods=[&apos;GET&apos;,&apos;POST&apos;])
def index():
    if request.method == &quot;POST&quot;:
        preds, image = get_prediction()
        final_preds = [p.tolist() for p in preds]
        return json.dumps({
            &apos;prediction&apos;: final_preds,
            &apos;image&apos;: image.tolist()
        })
    return &quot;Welcome to Neural Network Visualization&quot;
if __name__==&quot;__main__&quot;:
    app.run()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Create &lt;em&gt;Procfile&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes it has no extensions, so avoid adding any. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Procfile&lt;/code&gt; is used by Heroku&apos;s dynos to understand what commands are to be run on start up of application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;web:gunicorn app:app&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second part of the statment &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;app:app&lt;/code&gt; specifies that the app file has to be run. Suppose if the name of main file would have been &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;index.py&lt;/code&gt; we would have insted wrote&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;web:gunirn index:app&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Create a &lt;em&gt;runtime.txt&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This file is used to specify the python version we will be using in this dyno.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;python-3.7.6&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Create a &lt;em&gt;requirements.txt&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is used to store the pip modules that you have used and should be installed on your dyno to run your app smoothly. Don&apos;t worry if you haven&apos;t written the exact version of your pip modules, just the name should be enough, Heroku will install the latest version matching that name.&lt;br&gt;
An example of my &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;requirements.txt&lt;/code&gt; is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;tensorflow==1.14.0 
numpy==1.18.1
json5==0.9.1
Flask==1.1.1
gunicorn&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notice:&lt;/strong&gt; that I am using an old version of tensorflow 1.14.0 insted of latest ones 2.x.x because &lt;strong&gt;size wise the latest tensorflow package is above 500 MB&lt;/strong&gt; which results in &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;slug size too large&lt;/code&gt; errors while hosting your application on Heroku as the max size of application Heroku can allows is 500MB. Better to keep that in mind while creating your new app!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Run the following commands which will create an app in your Heroku account&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;heroku create &amp;lt;your-app-name&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Run the following commands to push your code to Heroku server&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;git init 
git add .
git commit -m &quot;&amp;lt;your-message&gt;
git push heroku master&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congrats your Flask app is hosted on Heroku :tada:! You can now view your app on Heroku&apos;s dashboard and change its settings from there&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;To Open your app on browser via terminal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure you are on the root folder of your app&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;heroku open&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Hosting Streamlit to Heroku&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will mainly need the following files to host your streamlit application on Heroku&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;app.py (core logic of your app)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Procfile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;requirements.txt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;setup.sh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After which you will have to do the following steps&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create an Heroku app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pushing your code to Heroku&apos;s server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Creating your streamlit App&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating a streamlit app is quite simple as it emphasises and primarily used on python scripting behaviour. They also have cool demos you can build while learing on their &lt;a href=&quot;streamlit.io&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My Streamlit application looks something like this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Importing all my stuff&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;import streamlit as st
import json
import requests
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.patches import Circle
import numpy as np &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decplring the URL of my server (you might wanna fill it with url of your own server)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;# Url of your Flask server
URL = &apos;&apos; &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding a title to my page and a sidebar where I will show my image&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;st.title(&apos;Neural Network Visualizer&apos;)
st.sidebar.markdown(&apos;## Input Image&apos;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the button &apos;Get random predicition&apos; is clicked&apos; the following code section inside if-statment will run.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which sends a post request to the URL collects it output, reshapes the image to a square size and adds it to the side bar. The for loop creats a graphical view from the values of each nodes in different layers and plots it in the end&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;if st.button(&apos;Get random prediction&apos;):
        response = requests.post(URL, data={})
        response = json.loads(response.text)
        preds = response.get(&apos;prediction&apos;)
        image = response.get(&apos;image&apos;)
        image = np.reshape(image, (28,28))
        st.sidebar.image(image, width=150)
        # print(preds)
        for layer, p in enumerate(preds):
                # print(layer,p)
                numbers = np.squeeze(np.array(p))
                plt.figure(figsize=(32,6))
                if layer == 2:
                        row = 1
                        col = 10
                else:
                        row = 2
                        col = 16
                for i, number in enumerate(numbers):
                        plt.subplot(row,col,i+1)
                        plt.imshow(number * np.ones((8,8,3)).astype(&apos;float32&apos;))
                        plt.xticks([])
                        plt.yticks([])
                        if layer == 2:
                                plt.xlabel(str(i), fontsize=40)
                plt.subplots_adjust(wspace=0.05, hspace=0.05)
                plt.tight_layout()
                st.text(&apos;Layer {}&apos;.format(layer+1))
                st.pyplot()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Creating a &lt;em&gt;Procfile&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure to now add any extensions like &apos;.txt&apos; while creating the file. Here we are telling the dyno to first run our setup.sh file (which we will be creating after this) and start our streamlit server after that. Streamlit servers are started with the command &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;streamlit run &amp;lt;filename&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Procfile:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;web: sh setup.sh &amp;amp;&amp;amp; streamlit run app.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Creating a &lt;em&gt;setup.sh&lt;/em&gt; file&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It helps us to create the necessary changes in the environment for our streamlit app to run smoothly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;echo &quot;\
[server]\n\
headless = true\n\
port = $PORT\n\
enableCORS = false\n\
\n\
&quot; &gt; ~/.streamlit/config.toml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Creating a &lt;em&gt;requirements.txt&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is used to store the pip modules that you have used and should be installed on your dyno to run your app smoothly. Heroku will automatically install all the pip modules written in this file. Don&apos;t worry if you haven&apos;t written the exact version of your pip modules, just the name should be enough, Heroku will install the latest version matching that name. An example of my &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;requirements.txt&lt;/code&gt; is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;numpy==1.18.1
json5==0.9.1
jsonschema==3.2.0
streamlit==0.61.0
matplotlib==3.1.3&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Creating an App on Heroku&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am assuming you have installed &lt;em&gt;heroku cli&lt;/em&gt; and logged in using &lt;em&gt;heroku login&lt;/em&gt;, if not follow the step given in the starting of this tutorial to setup Heroku cli and login using your account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create your app on Heroku by typing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;heroku create &amp;lt;your-app-name&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Run the following commands to push your code to Heroku server&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;git init 
git add .
git commit -m &quot;&amp;lt;your-message&gt;
git push heroku master&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congrats your Streamlit app is now hosted on Heroku :tada:! You can now view your app on Heroku&apos;s daskboard and change its settings from there&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;To Open your app on browser via terminal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure you are on the root folder of your app and run&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;heroku open&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before starting the blog I wanted to say that this is my first PyPI package and it is still in the development phase so if anyone finds it interesting, make sure to checkout funmark in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jai-dewani/fun-mark&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funmark is a python package that can be used for function benchmarking and then to analyze/compare their runtime and memory consumption using graph plots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this blog I will be using my funmark package to benchmark sorting functions, mainly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;QuickSort&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MergeSort&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TimSort&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s Start by first importing funmark and random.randint() for creating random arrays&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;import funmark
from random import randint&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s create functions for each sorting method&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;QuickSort&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;def partition(arr,low,high): 
    i = ( low-1 )         # index of smaller element 
    pivot = arr[high]     # pivot 
    for j in range(low , high): 
        if   arr[j] &amp;lt; pivot: 
            i = i+1 
            arr[i],arr[j] = arr[j],arr[i] 
  
    arr[i+1],arr[high] = arr[high],arr[i+1] 
    return ( i+1 ) 

def quickSort(argv): 
    arr = argv[0]
    low = argv[1]
    high = argv[2]
    if low &amp;lt; high: 
        pi = partition(arr,low,high) 
        quickSort([arr, low, pi-1]) 
        quickSort([arr, pi+1, high]) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;MergeSort&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;def mergeList(arr, l, m, r): 
    n1 = m - l + 1
    n2 = r- m 
    L = [0] * (n1) 
    R = [0] * (n2) 
    for i in range(0 , n1): 
        L[i] = arr[l + i] 
    for j in range(0 , n2): 
        R[j] = arr[m + 1 + j] 
    i = 0     
    j = 0 
    k = l     
    while i &amp;lt; n1 and j &amp;lt; n2 : 
        if L[i] &amp;lt;= R[j]: 
            arr[k] = L[i] 
            i += 1
        else: 
            arr[k] = R[j] 
            j += 1
        k += 1
    while i &amp;lt; n1: 
        arr[k] = L[i] 
        i += 1
        k += 1
    while j &amp;lt; n2: 
        arr[k] = R[j] 
        j += 1
        k += 1

def mergeSort(argv):
    arr = argv[0]
    l = argv[1]
    r = argv[2]
    if l &amp;lt; r: 
        m = (l+(r-1))//2 
        mergeSort([arr, l, m]) 
        mergeSort([arr, m+1, r]) 
        mergeList(arr, l, m, r) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;TimSort&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;def timSort(argv):
    ar = argv[0]
    ar.sort()
    return ar&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;BenchMarking the above functions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets create funmark.Benchmark() objects for each functions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;merge = funmark.Benchmark()
quick = funmark.Benchmark()
tim = funmark.Benchmark()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now lets create random arrays of sizes ranging from&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;listSize = 10
maxSize = 10**6
while listSize &amp;lt; maxSize:
    ar = [randint(1,10**5) for listSize in range(listSize)]
    
    time, memory = merge.run(quickSort, ar, 0, len(ar)-1)
    merge.add(len(ar), time, memory)
    
    time, memory= quick.run(mergeSort, ar, 0, len(ar)-1)
    quick.add(len(ar), time, memory)

    time, memory = tim.run(timSort, ar)
    tim.add(len(ar), time, memory)

    listSize = int(2*listSize)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each function, I am running .run(function Name, parameter) to get their runtime and memory usage, and then I am saving them to their respective objects using .add(size, time, memory)
At the last line of while loop and increasing the size of listSize so that we can get these values for different sizes of the list&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Plotting comparison graphs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;merge.compareTime(&quot;Length&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Compression between Sorting Algorithms&quot;, quick, tim)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I am plotting the graph of time with &lt;em&gt;merge&lt;/em&gt; and passing &lt;em&gt;quick&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;tim&lt;/em&gt; to plot all of them together, here is the result of this line&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see QuickSort even though has bigger worst case time complexity that MergeSort, its average case is much better due to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Auxiliary Space: Quicksort is an in-place sorting algorithm.  Merge sort on the other hand requires a temporary array to merge the sorted arrays and hence it is not in-place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worst case: The worst case of quicksort O(n^2) can be avoided by using randomized quicksort. It can be easily avoided with high probability by choosing the right pivot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locality of reference: Quicksort in particular exhibits good cache locality and this makes it faster than merge sort in many cases like in a virtual memory environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tail recursion: QuickSort is tail recursive while Merge sort is not. A tail recursive function is a function where a recursive call is the last thing executed by the function. They are considered better than non tail recursive functions as they can be optimized by the compiler before execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Tim Sort performs exceptionally better than both as expected, hence it&apos;s better to use python&apos;s in-build .sort() method as long as your need is plain sorting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;merge.compareMemory(&quot;Length&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Compression between Sorting Algorithms&quot;, quick, tim)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I am plotting the graph of memory with &lt;em&gt;mergeSort&lt;/em&gt; and passing &lt;em&gt;quickSort&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;timSort&lt;/em&gt; to plot all of them together, here is the result of this line&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plot for QuickSort is just below the TimSort plot hence it isn&apos;t clearly visible in this plot but from this we can understand that MergeSort requires extra space whereas QuickSort and TimSort don&apos;t!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was just a simple analysis of Sorting Algorithms but funmark can be used to do benchmark and analysis for any python code as long as it can be written in a function.&lt;/p&gt;

This was my first time participating in google hashcode. Since I didn&apos;t even know this competition existed till January 2020. After going through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/hashcode/about&quot;&gt;official website&lt;/a&gt; I thought it&apos;s is just another Algorithmic Team-based Competitive programming contest but turns out hashcode is one of its type of contest where you get to solve a real-life problem which is faced by engineers at google which at this moment can&apos;t be solved exactly so you have to aim for the best possible solution and the more close you get to that perfect solution, the more points you earn during the contest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contest is of 4 hours with 1 problem and 6 testcases in separate text files which are openly available. You need to write a solution and run it locally on your system (make sure you have a good system, because it will be helpful) with the given testcases given, and submit the outputs in a text file on the basis of which you earn points. Might wanna rent a cheap cloud space for four hours if you don&apos;t trust your system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google provides a sample problem to get some idea of how the problems at hashcode are like so we decided to solve the practice problem a week before the contest to get some idea of how to approach the main contest but ended up postponing it till the evening when the actual contest was supposed to take place, still, we still discovered a lot of things like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They don&apos;t need a perfect solution, just a good approximation will work! Which helped in narrowing down our approach during the actual contest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try not to apply DP or some other heavy memory-hungry solution to get a perfect answer. It&apos;s about getting the best solution possible (I guess this is what soft computing is!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to aim a good balance between memory and processing while building a solution so that you are able to get some iterations of output during the 4 hours of the contest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A cheap hack can be: use hashmaps, heaps, priority queue whenever possible as it will help you search for items faster&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&apos;t waste time thinking a lot, Don&apos;t wait too long! If you can code it without too much hassle. Do it and see how it affects your score.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no limit on the number of submissions and also they will consider your best score as the final answer for each file independently&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suppose there are two test cases A and B.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the first submission you get 20 and 2 points for testcase A and B respectively&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the second submission you get 3 and 30 points for testcase A and B respectively&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At last, the total score will be 20 + 30.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use this to create solutions for each testcase independently if nothing else is working. One algorithm might work well for A, Another one might work well with B.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warning: Solution Discussion Ahead&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After our first submission where we just chose the first library which had the least signup time, we got somewhat 8 Million points. Then we started considering the Total profit of the library per unit of time wasted on signup which gave us 13M at first and 15M after some minor tweaking and suddenly we realized we were selecting the libraries having the least Profit per unit signup time which was supposed to be maximum because we want the maximum profit in minimum span of time (don&apos;t know why this flawed method even brought us to 15M from 8M). Just after updating a single line, we Jumped from 15M to 26M! That too without the D testcase because it was taking too much time to run, adding the output of D testcase gave us a little boost of .25M points which is where we ran out of time.&lt;/p&gt;
