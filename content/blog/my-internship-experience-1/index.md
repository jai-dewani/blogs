My first month of Internship!!! The starting date was from 4th Jan (Monday) and I was so excited to receive my company laptop along with headphone, mouse, a bag and a box of dry fruits (because why not üòÇ) 

I received my laptop just 2 days before my joining date (lucky me, some people got it 2 days late :p) but as soon as we opened it, there it was, a password between me and my laptop. Searched every corner of the box but no luck had to wait till the joining date for the password. 

Had my first meeting with HR, got my laptop passwords ü§© in a short meeting (literally 5 mins) after lunch on the first day. We were told we would have a meeting with our teammates and a ramp-up session just after that but nothing happened on that day. The biggest mistake I did was not exploring the laptop on my own because I was scared I would do something wrong. I received emails on Tuesday on my work email which I would have checked if I would have explored my laptop ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è and so went by Wednesday and at last the team lead called me on phone the next day to help me set up the laptop which I could have done on my own if I wasn't that scared to of messing things up.

After all the embarrassment settled, I had another meeting with my team member who would be my mentors while assigning the next tasks, and also buddies while helping me navigate through the internship. Luckily I was tasked with learning C# and then .NET as I will be assigned to the backend team, now you might ask why is it lucky to be assigned C#. Well because the other intern was asked to learn Angular with TypeScript ü•ï (don't worry if you don't get the carrot, hail Ben Award)  

TLDR: Big companies "usually" have a more relaxed culture. The perfect thing my lazy ass. 

### "My take on startups vs mnc"

The first day we had just a meeting with HR for 5 mins, that's it. And I saw my friends who got placed at startups were asked to learn things 1-2 weeks before their internship started (some even 1-2 months) so they could be productive from the first day they join on the payroll. This all comes down to the amount of money big-stable companies have to spend on interns and not extract every ounce of talent from them. 

Don't consider me wrong, I am not saying startups are bad that they do this, I would recommend fresh graduates to opt for startups if they wanna learn a lot of things in a short period and jump to a bigger fish with all that knowledge as they can provide a fast-paced learning curve to properly boost your knowledge while wearing different hats at each corner but you will have to devote your time as you have to do to learn a lot of things in a short period.

I love talking about this analogy where we were told that "Just give all you got/all your life into JEE for these 2 years and then it will be all smooth sailing", and of course that is not the case but.....but grinding your ass for those 2 years does help, it gives you a good stage but more importantly it teaches you the art of "grinding" because that is the one thing that will separate the intelligent lazy ass (me) from the hard-working one. 

### Ramp up

So Ramp up means teaching you all the basic things to a new joinee so they can work on the project they will be assigned to, in my case this ramp up meant learning C# and .NET Framework (not .NET Core, don't worry if you don't get this .NET has it's own rich and confusing history >_<) 

At the end of the second week of Jan, we got a proper introduction to the different projects that are in our Carl Zeiss VTS division and also the project we will be working on!!!

Also, my first task was into something I had only read about in our Operating System classes but now I got to work on it. Inter-process communication (IPC) which most of us saw and thought like, "Hehe, like we are gonna use this low-level communication already baked into most of the development products as our first task on our internship, lol" and to this, I say "OS is important"! You might now need to implement the low-level communication that happens between a process to another process as well as a process to its child process, but some sort of idea on how this works would go a long way, it certainly did in my case. 

Spend the whole 3rd week on researching about different IPC's and which would be better to use, then going about creating a Poof of Concept (POC) using that communication protocol so that the team can be sure it is a viable option to use this specific communication mechanism for our use case. 

Week 4 was a bit slower so I focused more on learning new things in the .NET framework and sometime on Thursday I got my next task which would require me to do the first push on the official codebase and I wouldn't be an intern if I didn't cause a problem while using git and pushing coding, right? üòù

And with my first month as a FullStack Intern got an end. It was chill, to be honest. Not a lot of pressure or deadlines, but as one would expect this was going to change soon üò≠
