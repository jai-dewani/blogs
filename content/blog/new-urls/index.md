The .new domain was first noticed when google allowed people to quickly open a new doc by typing [doc.new](http://doc.new) after which they started the process of opening its .new-powered shortcuts to other companies.

You must have heard about these two cool URLs, [repo.new](http://repo.new), and [gist.new](http://gist.new) to quickly create a new GitHub repository and GitHub gist. It's a cool little trick to do in front of your friend and even helpful if you are the kind of person who creates repositories and gists left and right every day but it turns out that there a lot more of these which might actually be helpful at times and I have created a list of them

- [repo.new](http://repo.new): Create a new GitHub repository  
- [gist.new](http://gist.new): Create a new GitHub gist  
- [cal.new](http://cal.new): Create a new Calendar event  
- [link.new](http://link.new): Create a new Bitly link  
- [story.new](http://story.new): Create a new Medium story 
- [docs.new](http://docs.new): Create a new Google doc  
- [sheets.new](http://sheets.new): Create a new Goole spreadsheet  
- [slides.new](http://slides.new): Create a new Google slide presentation  
- [forms.new](http://forms.new): Create a new  Google form

- [vue.new](http://vue.new): Create a new  Vue codesandbox

Hopefully, more of these will popup and I will try my best to keep this up to date :)
