Ever saw CTC of around 40-50 Lakhs with base of 12-15 Lakhs and wondered were are the rest of 30-35 Lakhs? Yeah, me too. 

And yes, these number are from an actual company that exists in this earth! So here I will try my best to uncover what all goes to boost a 12-15 Lakh base to 40-50 Lakh CTC.

Everyone looking for colleges, specially in Computer Science focus a lot on placement stats. What were the average packages provided, the companies which visited and the highest packages provided. Not often but we would see these huge packages of 50 LPA and instantly start dividing it by 12 and thinking 4 Lakhs per month....daaam üòç We all did this, didn't we? üòì

First lets understand what is CTC. It means Cost to Company, so basically the amount company is going to spend on you, which can be in various ways like 
- Health Care
- Life Insurance
- Food expenses

- Company Shares 
- Travel Cost 
- Bonus (usually year end bonus, may depend on your performance)
- Joining bonus (mostly one time) 
- Relocation Bonus (mostly one time) 
- And the amount that will be actually sent to your back account. 

Now there are a lot of fine print when it comes to the total CTC, some recurring ones are

- **Bonus:** In simple term bonus incudes the extra money you will get at the year end. There are various way of menitioning this in CTC, some of th most common ones are: 
    - Direct Bonus: This directly mentions the bonus you'll get at the year end
    - Performance Based Bonus: A minimum bonus will be mentioned but you can get more than this if you perform good. A lot of companies are using this strategy to hype there employees to perform good. In my opinion this is a good measure 
    - X Bonux Vested in 4 years: This means the bonus will be divided in 4 years and X/4 amount will be given to you at the end of each year, mentioning the bonus of 4 years and adding it to CTC which is supposed to represent the cost of one year isn't a good pratice in my opinion.   

- **Company Shares:** Companies have started providing there shares to employess to make them feel responsible and take iniciative. Shares can be provided in two forms 
    - Exact amount: Say 1000 shares, so the company will give you 1000 of there shares
    - Amount of shares: The company will give you there shares that are worth that much amount at this point in time

    The amount of shares writen in CTC is usually the combined worth of 4 years, which will be provided to you equaly say 25% per year but companies tend to divide the share in an un-even fashion (like *10%, 15%, 25%, 50%*) to force employes to stay for atleast 4 years allowing there shares mature. Aside from the un-even division what needs to be focused is that the total amount of 4 years worth of shares is included in CTC which is supposed to represent the cost of each year. 

A lot of Big Engineering companies are following the these method of hyping up the CTC even if it doesn't represent the actual amount you will receive in a year which has lead the small startups/companies to do the same because at the end not a lot of people look behind the CTC in the first view which has become the main attraction point for attracting Developers/Students

- **Joining Bonus and Relocation Bonus:** You will usually get this amount just once when you join the company and will not be present in your second year so technically your gross salary will decrease in the second year. How great is that, right? 

In the end what we need to realise is that the CTC we all see and crave is the entire story.
