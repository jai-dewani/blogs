Hence the first step before doing any analysis is to convert them to CSV format yet there isn't a standard or a simplified way to do so, hence I am sharing what I have scavenged from the web while doing my project which was Implimenting the paper <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.02656.pdf\">Deep Packet: A Novel Approach For Encrypted Traffic Classification Using Deep Learning</a></p>\n<p>This method has been tested on Ubuntu and should work on any other linux platform.</p>\n<h2>Install argus via terminal</h2>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">sudo apt-get install argus-client</code></p>\n<h2>Convert .pcap to .argus file format</h2>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">argus -r filename.pcap -w filename.argus</code><br>\n-r &#x3C;FILE> Read FILE<br>\n-w &#x3C;FILE> Write FILE</p>\n<h2>Convert .argus to .csv file forrmat while choosing which features to extract</h2>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">ra -r filename.argus -u -s &lt;features-comma-seprated></code></p>\n<p>Example:<br>\n<code class=\"language-text\">ra -r filename.argus -u -s rank, stime, ltime, dur</code></p>\n<p>-r &#x3C;FILE> Read FILE<br>\n-u Print time values using Unix time format (seconds from the Epoch).<br>\n-s Specify the fields to print.</p>\n<p>The list of available fields to print can be found <a href=\"http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/man1/ra.1.html\">here</a>. After selecting your required set of fields this indeed is a very short and effective way of converting .pcap to .csv for further analysis which in my case was Deep Learning</p>\n<p>Hope this helps you :)</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Converting .pcap to .csv using command line","date":"October 06, 2020","description":"In my deep learning project when was asked to train a model on network traffic to classify malicious packects from non malicious ones.
